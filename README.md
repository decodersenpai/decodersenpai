# What is DecoderSenpai ?

Currently it is just a repository with learning materials to excel in different fields(WebDev,ML,etc) of CS. But the aim is to turn it into a Ed-Tech company where Computer Science is given a new meaning. Where students can explore,create,have fun.(Be the swissknife of Tech). 

# Motivation

In past few years I(@ArjitS1) have noticed that my peers instead of having fun & solve problems with tech, have turned it into some sort of money making machine where there is a syllabus they need to finish, excel in interviews and get into that dream company. I on the other hand believe Yes financial stability is important but limiting Coding into boundations of syllabus is limiting the potential of it.

# How is it different ?

There are tons of learning platforms, how is it different? 
Well, the major difference is it contains well researched learning material and practical exercises. A perfect balance of Learn-Create cycle. We make sure that there is no Tutorial Hell and you eventually lead up to create some cool real world project. We do not help you create copy-paste code along project, but discuss the core concept behind creating a project.

# Subjects that will be taught 

- Web Development
- Core Computer Science
- Data Structure & Algorithms
- Others(ML,Blockchain,Cloud etc)

# Current Status

* Contains different Repos for different subjects
* Each Subject Repo has notes,flashcards,mini-projects,major-project,exercises
* I am the only person working on @decodersenpai.
